# Steane-s-Code-with-Pauli-Error-Channel
The following code takes a boolean (of size n) and a probability p and encodes the boolean into n quantum registers of size seven using Steane's encoding, then runs the registers through a Pauli error channel where error is introduced with probability p, then uses Steane's code for error detection and correction.
